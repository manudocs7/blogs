# The Problem We Are Solving

## A Fragmented Trade System That Discourages Participation

India’s export–import ecosystem is structurally fragmented.

Today, an exporter or importer must depend on multiple independent intermediaries—including Customs House Agents (CHAs), freight forwarders, logistics providers, port authorities, container freight stations (CFS), banks, and regulatory bodies—each operating on separate systems, timelines, and incentives.

There is no single source of truth.

As a result, executing even a single shipment becomes operationally complex, time-consuming, opaque, and unpredictable.

This fragmentation is one of the primary reasons why only 0.27% of India’s 7.2 crore MSMEs participate in exports, despite having the capability, product quality, and intent to serve global markets.



## Complexity Beyond Capability

The challenge is not manufacturing capacity.  
The challenge is operational coordination.

An exporter must simultaneously:

- Coordinate with multiple agents across documentation, logistics, and compliance
- Track changing regulations across customs, ports, and trade agreements
- Ensure document accuracy under evolving rules
- Manage delays, penalties, and compliance risks without real-time visibility

This complexity leads to:

- Higher cost of trade
- Increased risk of fines and penalties
- Heavy dependence on intermediaries
- Uncertainty in shipment timelines

Over time, this discourages MSMEs from entering—or continuing—in global trade altogether.



## A Dynamic Market with Static Tools

Global trade is inherently dynamic.

Regulations, duties, port rules, documentation requirements, and market conditions change frequently—often without timely, structured, or personalized dissemination to MSMEs.

Most Indian exporters and importers become aware of regulatory changes only when:

- A shipment is delayed
- A document is rejected
- A fine or penalty is imposed

This lack of real-time, contextual intelligence leads to avoidable losses and steadily erodes trust in the export–import process.



## Disconnected Systems, Disconnected Decisions

Despite national initiatives such as NLP Marine, rail and port digitization efforts, and broader logistics modernization programs, exporters still interact with the ecosystem through disconnected interfaces and manual coordination.

What is missing is a unified digital operating layer—one that:

- Connects all stakeholders
- Understands documentation context
- Applies current regulations automatically
- Guides exporters through compliant, optimized decision-making

The gap lies not in policy intent, but in last-mile execution.



## Cost Opacity: The Hidden Profit Killer

For most MSMEs, the true cost of exporting is never clear upfront.

Exporters often:

- Do not know the actual landed cost in advance
- Face surprise charges at ports, CFSs, or during customs clearance
- Struggle to price competitively for global buyers

This cost opacity directly impacts profitability and makes exports financially risky—especially for smaller enterprises operating on thin margins.



## The Trust & Accountability Gap

In a fragmented ecosystem, accountability is diffused.

When multiple agents are involved:

- No single entity owns the end-to-end outcome
- Delays and failures are passed between stakeholders
- MSMEs lack bargaining power and transparency

As a result, exporters operate with limited control, limited visibility, and limited recourse—making global trade feel uncertain and fragile.



## The Data & Intelligence Vacuum

Most MSMEs operate without access to actionable trade intelligence.

They often:

- Lack visibility into global demand trends
- Do not know which markets are growing or declining
- Are unaware of product-market export readiness
- Cannot assess regulatory or compliance risk by destination

Without structured data and intelligence, decision-making remains reactive rather than strategic—limiting scale, resilience, and long-term competitiveness.



## The Resulting National Impact

These challenges have systemic consequences:

- Persistently low MSME participation in exports
- High cost of trade
- Longer dwell times at ports
- Reduced global competitiveness
- Ongoing trade deficits

The issue is not entrepreneurial intent.  
The issue is systemic fragmentation.



## Our Approach: A Single Digital Trade Layer

We are solving this by building ManuDocs—an AI-powered, unified digital layer for export and import operations.

ManuDocs enables exporters and importers to:

- Execute shipments from a single platform
- Digitally file and validate documents as per current regulations
- Receive hyper-personalized market insights and regulatory updates
- Connect efficiently with buyers and sellers
- Reduce dependence on fragmented intermediaries
- Minimize compliance risks and penalties
- Optimize trade decisions for higher profitability

In essence, ManuDocs allows exporters and importers to manage global trade from their office—through one intelligent system.



## The Outcome We Are Driving

By simplifying and standardizing export–import operations, ManuDocs aims to:  
Increase MSME participation in Indian exports from 0.27% to 5–6% over the next 5–7 years.

This transformation will:

- Expand India’s export base
- Strengthen manufacturing demand
- Generate large-scale employment
- Improve foreign exchange reserves
- Support India’s transition from trade deficit to trade surplus
