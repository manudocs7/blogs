##  How ManuDocs Is Eliminating Manual Agent Dependency by Running on Government Digital Rails

From Fragmented Agent Dependency to Unified Digital Trade Execution

Once exporters and importers find buyers, suppliers, and market intelligence, they face the next biggest bottleneck in global trade:
Heavy dependence on manual agents, disconnected workflows, delays, errors, and zero transparency.
Today’s export–import execution system in India is:
Agent-driven


Paper-heavy


WhatsApp- and email-based


Non-transparent


Error-prone


This dependency increases:
Clearance delays


Compliance risks


Penalties


Costs


And most importantly, fear of scaling global trade


ManuDocs solves this problem not by bypassing the system, but by building on top of India’s official digital trade infrastructure.

## Learning from India’s Payment Revolution: Build on Public Rails

India already has a proven model for large-scale transformation.
Before digital payments:
People depended on banks, cash handlers, intermediaries


Payments were slow, costly, and manual


Then came National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
By building UPI as a public digital rail, India enabled:
Multiple private platforms


Instant payments


Transparency


Massive adoption


 The key lesson:
Don’t replace the ecosystem. Standardize and digitize it using public infrastructure.
ManuDocs applies the same philosophy to global trade execution.


##  Running ManuDocs on India’s National Logistics & Trade Rails

ManuDocs is designed to operate on top of official government systems, not parallel to them.
At the core is NLP Marine, which is already integrated with:
Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP)


PCS1x


Indian Customs


Goods and Services Tax (GST)


Terminal Operating Systems (TOS)


10+ participating government and port authorities


 This means ManuDocs is rail-aligned, compliant by design, and future-proof.


##  Role-Based Digital Participation for the Entire Trade Ecosystem

ManuDocs is not exporter-only or agent-only.
 It is a multi-stakeholder execution platform with role-based access.
On ManuDocs:
Exporters


Importers


Customs House Agents (CHAs)


Freight forwarders


Logistics partners


Port operators


…each get defined digital roles, permissions, and responsibilities.
 This removes ambiguity and ensures accountability at every step.

 ##  AI-Assisted Filing Built on Indian Trade Rules

 At the heart of ManuDocs is rule-aware automation.
Our AI models are trained on:
DGFT rules and procedures (Directorate General of Foreign Trade)


Customs regulations


Port and shipping norms


GST compliance logic


Historical filing patterns


Instead of exporters manually coordinating with multiple agents:
ManuDocs assists in preparing shipping bills


Validates data before submission


Flags errors before customs filing


Reduces rejections, penalties, and delays


 Automation here is compliance-first, not shortcut-driven.


##  Intelligent Document Management with OCR & Templates

Export–import documentation repeatedly uses the same data:
Company details


IEC


GST


Product descriptions


HS codes


Addresses


ManuDocs solves this by:
Creating a persistent business profile


Securely storing commonly used documents


Extracting data via OCR


Mapping fields into standard government-approved templates


This enables:
One-time data entry


Zero repetitive paperwork


Faster filings


Consistency across shipments


 Less manual typing = fewer errors = faster clearance.


##  Flexible Filing Options: Control or Assisted Execution

ManuDocs does not remove choice — it removes friction.
Exporters and importers can choose:
Option 1: Self-Filing (Full Control)
Use their own DSC


Review every document


Submit with 100% intent and visibility


Option 2: CHA-Assisted Filing
Choose a CHA on the platform


CHA files on their behalf


CHA handles on-ground customs interventions if cargo is stuck


Option 3: ManuDocs Assisted Digital Execution
A professional execution team handles filings


Standardized SOPs


Platform-level accountability


No dependency on unstructured agents


 Choice remains — chaos does not.


 ##  End-to-End Transparency & Shipment Tracking

 With all workflows unified:
Every shipment is digitally tracked


Status updates are visible in real time


Responsibilities are clearly logged


Communication moves from WhatsApp to structured workflows


Exporters and importers gain:
Predictability


Auditability


Confidence to scale


 Transparency is no longer a privilege — it becomes default.

## The Real Outcome: Time Saved, Cost Reduced, Trust Restored
By running on government rails and digitizing execution:
Delays reduce


Errors drop


Penalties decline


Agent markups become visible


Decision-making improves


Most importantly:
Exporters and importers stop fearing the process.
And when fear is removed, participation increases.

##  Conclusion: Digitizing Execution Is the Missing Link

Buyer discovery and intelligence bring exporters to the door.
 Execution efficiency decides whether they walk through it.
ManuDocs solves the execution problem by:
Building on India’s official digital trade infrastructure


Standardizing workflows


Automating compliance


Preserving choice


Creating transparency


This is not just operational improvement.
This is how global trade becomes scalable, trustworthy, and inclusive for India.
