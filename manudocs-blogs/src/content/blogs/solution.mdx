## Building an Unified Digital Trade Operating Layer

ManuDocs is designed as a unified digital operating layer for India’s export–import ecosystem—integrating documentation workflows, compliance support, logistics coordination, and decision intelligence into a single, intelligent platform.

At its core, ManuDocs addresses fragmentation by connecting systems and stakeholders, not replacing them.



## Official Integration with National Trade Infrastructure

ManuDocs operates as an officially licensed service provider on the NLP Marine ecosystem, India’s national digital trade and logistics infrastructure.

As a licensed service provider, ManuDocs is designed to securely interface—through approved and permitted APIs—with NLP Marine and its associated subsidiary platforms. This enables exporters and importers to access multiple government and logistics systems through a single digital workflow, rather than navigating numerous disconnected portals.

This integration spans systems operating across multiple ministries and departments, allowing ManuDocs to function as a last-mile execution and coordination layer for national trade digitization efforts.



## How ManuDocs Uses NLP Marine & Its Subsidiaries

### ICEGATE

ManuDocs leverages ICEGATE-linked workflows to:

- Assist exporters and importers in the preparation and digital filing of Shipping Bills and Bills of Entry
- Enable filing using the exporter’s/importer’s own Digital Signature Certificate (DSC), with explicit user consent
- Monitor customs-related status updates, acknowledgements, and system responses
- Reduce manual errors, duplicate data entry, and follow-ups during customs clearance

All filings are executed only after user authorization, with ManuDocs acting strictly as a facilitating digital layer—not as a signatory, filer of record, or statutory authority.

This enables exporters and importers to manage customs-facing processes from a single platform, while retaining full regulatory control, ownership, and compliance responsibility.



### ULIP

Through ULIP-aligned integrations, ManuDocs enables:

- Visibility across rail, road, port, and container movement events
- Unified tracking of logistics milestones across fragmented transport systems
- Better coordination between documentation workflows and physical cargo movement

This reduces uncertainty, improves planning accuracy, and shortens turnaround times across the shipment lifecycle.



### PCS 1x

Using PCS 1x interfaces, ManuDocs facilitates:

- Access to port and terminal operating status
- Visibility into container freight stations (CFS) and port authorities
- Centralized tracking of cargo handling and port-level events

This allows exporters, importers, and their agents to track port-side operations digitally rather than relying on manual follow-ups.




### Unified Outcome

By securely aggregating data and events from NLP Marine and its subsidiary systems, ManuDocs:

- Consolidates documents, status updates, and approvals into a single workflow
- Eliminates information silos
- Reduces dependency on phone calls, emails, and fragmented intermediaries



## AI-Driven Documentation & Compliance Intelligence

Documentation remains the most error-prone and costly component of global trade.

ManuDocs addresses this through AI-assisted documentation intelligence, trained on:

- Standardized trade document formats
- Publicly available regulatory guidelines
- Templates issued by Chambers of Commerce and relevant authorities

Our AI systems assist with:

- Intelligent document preparation and validation
- Structured extraction of invoice, packing list, and shipping data
- HS code suggestions and product description mapping
- Context-aware compliance checks based on destination, commodity, and applicable trade rules

This helps ensure documentation is:

- More accurate at first submission
- Better aligned with prevailing regulations
- Less prone to avoidable rejections, delays, and penalties

(Final statutory responsibility remains with the exporter, importer, or licensed agent.)



## End-to-End Digital Filing, Tracking & Visibility

ManuDocs digitizes the entire shipment coordination lifecycle.

Users can:

- Prepare and manage documents digitally
- Track shipment and clearance milestones across logistics touchpoints
- Monitor customs and cargo status updates
- Access all relevant documents through a unified dashboard

This transforms trade operations from a reactive, phone-call-driven process into a predictable and transparent digital workflow.



## Flexible Execution: Digital-First or Assisted by CHAs

ManuDocs supports both self-service and assisted execution models.

Exporters and importers may:

- Manage processes digitally on their own, or
- Engage licensed Customs House Agents (CHAs) onboarded on the platform

CHAs operating through ManuDocs benefit from:

- Structured, platform-driven workflows
- Shared visibility with clients
- Transparent task tracking and documentation exchange

This preserves the role of intermediaries while significantly reducing opacity and coordination friction.



## Secure, Trusted & Paperless by Design

ManuDocs is built with security, traceability, and trust as foundational principles.

Key safeguards include:

- Tamper-evident document verification (including blockchain-inspired audit trails where applicable)
- Reduction of redundant paperwork through digital workflows and banking integrations
- Time-stamped digital records supporting audits, compliance, and accountability

This creates a trusted digital trade record for businesses, financial institutions, and regulators.



## Hyper-Personalized Market & Trade Intelligence

Beyond execution, ManuDocs empowers users with AI-assisted trade intelligence, including:

- Export market discovery insights by product category
- High-level demand and sourcing indicators by geography
- Regulatory and compliance alerts by destination
- Early risk signals based on trade patterns and rule changes

These insights support better-informed trade decisions, without replacing professional or regulatory judgment.



## Enabling National Outcomes Through Platform-Level Execution

By operating as a licensed digital execution layer aligned with national initiatives, ManuDocs supports:

- Reduced dwell times and operational friction
- Improved coordination across trade stakeholders
- Greater MSME participation in global trade
- Alignment with India’s vision for efficient, technology-driven trade infrastructure

ManuDocs does not compete with national systems—it amplifies their impact at the last mile.



## In Summary

ManuDocs addresses fragmentation by:

- Officially integrating with NLP Marine and its subsidiary systems
- Unifying documentation, logistics, and compliance workflows
- Applying AI to reduce errors and regulatory risk
- Offering flexible digital and assisted execution models
- Delivering actionable, contextual trade intelligence



## Our Commitment to Accuracy & Responsible Claims

Because ManuDocs operates in a highly regulated and nationally significant domain, we adhere to strict principles:

- All integrations are pursued through approved and licensed mechanisms
- AI outputs are assistive, not authoritative
- Data sources are clearly defined and lawfully accessed
- No confidential government data is accessed or stored without authorization
- National impact goals are directional, not guarantees

Over time, anonymized and aggregated trade data—handled responsibly—can support:

- Infrastructure planning
- Policy feedback loops
- Export strategy formulation

All within legal, ethical, and regulatory boundaries.
