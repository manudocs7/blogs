## The Most Critical Problem Indian MSMEs & SMEs Face Today : Lack of Buyers Abroad & Actionable Market Insight 


India’s MSME Sector Is Huge — But Struggling with Exports and import
Indian MSMEs are often called the backbone of the economy — they contribute around 30.1 %  to GDP, 35.4% of manufacturing, 45.73 % of export  and over 110 million people they employ.
Yet despite this scale, many export-oriented MSMEs owners struggle to find actual buyers overseas — and this is not just a commercial problem, it’s a national economic bottleneck.

## The Core Export Problem: Lack of Buyers — Not Products

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/prXvMPbh/buyers-neede.png" alt="buyers-needed" />

While Indian MSMEs produce exportable goods — from textiles and machinery to handicrafts — the real blocker is discovering reliable international buyers and market opportunities, not manufacturing capacity.
Most MSMEs don’t have access to:

Verified buyer databases


Market demand insights


Country-specific export opportunities


This means even good products go unsold abroad, throttling growth, jobs, and foreign exchange inflows.

According to public export analyses:
MSMEs struggle to identify potential international buyers and distribution channels.


Basic export information is scattered, poorly consolidated online, and buried across multiple complex government sites.


Without strategic market insights, MSMEs give up on exports early despite investment and effort.

This is a foundational gap — not a marginal inconvenience.

## Expensive Tools Exist — But They Are Ineffective for MSMEs

Large market research and export intelligence tools like Cybex, Seair, CyperExim, Volza, Eximpedia, The Trade Vision, Dollar Business, and other B2B databases do provide trade data.
  But most Indian MSME owners complain:

/>

These tools are very expensive — costs are often unaffordable for small firms.


Data comes as raw spreadsheets — dense, technical, and not actionable.


They require expert interpretation — which MSMEs often lack time or training for.

In reality, these tools provide generic export data — not hyper-personalized, buyer-linked insights. That’s like giving a farmer a giant map of the world and expecting him to find fertile land — without directions, contacts, trends, or context.
Government export support websites also suffer from similar flaws:

Scattered information across multiple portals


No centralized market or buyer discovery system


Difficult bureaucratic presentation (complex terms, PDFs, spreadsheets)

  MSMEs often give up even after paying for premium tools or spending hours.

  ##   Importers Face the Same Discovery Problem 

  Importers — who could supply raw material, finished goods, or re-export products — face the inverse issue:

  They can’t efficiently find reliable overseas suppliers.


They resort to costly intermediaries or trade agents.


They waste time on generic portals that don’t filter by product quality, compliance, price, or risk.


In both cases — exporters and importers — there is no personalized match-making or market intelligence engine for Indian MSMEs.


## This Gap Has Real Consequences for India’s Economy

Market access helps businesses diversify, earn foreign exchange, and build resilient supply chains. Without it:

MSMEs remain dependent on local or regional markets with low growth ceilings.


India loses global opportunities and export diversification potential.


Jobs, investment, and GDP growth get suppressed.


Exporters without buyers = growth choked at the source.

## Other Hidden Barriers Amplify the Problem

The lack of buyer discovery compounds other export issues:
Complex export compliance and documentation requirements.


Payment delays and currency risk from overseas buyers.


Limited access to export financing, credit, and risk mitigation.


But the starting point still remains: No buyers, no demand means no export orders — period.


## The Real Need: Hyper-Personalized Market & Buyer Insights — Not Spreadsheets

What MSMEs truly need is not raw trade data — but:

 Verified buyer contacts
 Market demand signals by product & geography
  Actionable insights (e.g., list of buyers + contact + demand trends)
  Tailored export recommendations
 Competitive pricing benchmarks
  Trade compliance guidance
  Supplier discovery for importers
This kind of hyper-personalized insight leads to decisions, not confusion.
